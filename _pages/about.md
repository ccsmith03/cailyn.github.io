I'm a first-year Robotics PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Dr. Henny Admoni and Dr. Zackory Erickson. I'm passionate about research in human-robot interaction, shared autonomy, and reinforcement learning. I'm also a 2024 NSF Graduate Research Fellow.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Colorado School of Mines. During undergrad, I conducted research advised by Dr. Tom Williams and Dr. Kaveh Fathian. I was previously a Caltech WAVE Fellow at Dr. Soon-Jo Chung's lab. I've worked as a software engineer at Autonomous Solutions Inc. and as a software engineering intern at two engineering companies.
